\section{Coin and Multi-Asset Tokens}
\label{sec:coin-ma}

In this chapter we introduce an algebraic structure, $\ValMonoid$,
which we define to be a monoid with several additional functions.
The monoidal structure and additional functions represent the
features required in order to treat terms as \emph{assets},
which includes the ability to do certain accounting operations on them (addition, etc.),
as well as some other operations (see below).
These operations are used to describe the ShelleyMA transaction processing rules
without indicating what concrete type the $\ValMonoid$ monoid must be.

In order to give a concrete ledger specification, a concrete type
endowed with $\ValMonoid$ structure must be used in its place.
Depending on the concrete type selected for this purpose,
we obtain distinct ledgers. In particular, we get

\begin{itemize}
  \item the Allegra ledger rules with $\Coin$, and
  \item the Mary ledger rules with $\Value$ (a type that represents a heterogeneous collection of assets in a
  single term)
\end{itemize}

Below we give the definitions of all the functions that must be defined on
$\Coin$ and $\Value$ in order for them to have the structure of $\ValMonoid$.
We also give several other types which we can meaningfully
support the definition of the required functions (addition, size, etc.).
These types are convertible to and from the $\Value$ type, and appear in other
parts of the system as a multi-asset representation which is more suitable in particular
usecases.

\subsection{$\ValMonoid$}

Figure \ref{fig:ValMonoid} gives names and types of functions which
make up the $\ValMonoid$ structure.

\subsection{$\Coin$ in the Allegra era}

For the Allegra era, we require the $\ValMonoid$ asset representation to support
only a single asset, Ada, whose type we call $\Coin$. This section defines the
$\ValMonoid$ functions for the $\Coin$ type, see Figure
\ref{fig:coin}. Addition and multiplication are defined in the usual way
(as on $\Integer$).

When multi-asset support on the ledger is introduced, Ada ($\Coin$) is still expected to be
the most common type of token on the ledger.
It is the only
type of token that can be used for all non-UTxO ledger accounting, including deposits,
fees, rewards, treasury, and the proof of stake protocol. For this reason, not
all occurrences of $\Coin$ inside a transaction or in the ledger state can or
should be replaced with the abstract $\ValMonoid$.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Relation between $\fun{inject}$ and $\fun{coin}$.}
When composed as

\[\fun{coin} \circ \fun{inject} = \fun{id}_{\Coin}\]

these functions give the identity on $\Coin$, but composed in the opposite order as

\[\fun{inject} \circ \fun{coin}\]

they return a $\ValMonoid$ containing only the Ada tokens contained in the original $\ValMonoid$.

\textbf{Fungible and non-fungible tokens.}
Recall that a token is said to be fungible at a specific time (slot $s$, for example) if
there are two or more tokens in existence on the ledger that are indistinguishable from
each other, ie. they have the exact same identifier. Tokens with the same
identifier are fungible with each other, but not with tokens with a different identifier.

If there exists only a single
token with a given identifier, it is said to be unique (or non-fungible).
The usual meaning of \emph{non-fungible token} implies, additionally to the
requirement that a token is unique on the ledger at a given time, that
it is programmatically guaranteed to remain unique indefinitely. This
type of guarantee can be encoded in a minting policy.


\subsection{Multi-assets and $\Value$ in the Mary Era}

Terms of the $\Value$ type represent heterogeneous collections of assets,
both user-defined, and Ada. In place of the abstract $\ValMonoid$ structure,
this type is used in the concrete Mary era ledger.
This section describes the type $\Value$, the operations required on
it, its relation to $\Coin$. It also as gives the definitions of the
$\ValMonoid$ functions on $\Value$.

Figure \ref{fig:defs:value} introduces the basic types that make up the $\Value$ type,
as well as defining the functions required to for $\Value$ to be a $\ValMonoid$.

  \caption{$\ValMonoid$ Function Definitions and Auxiliary Functions for Value}
  \label{fig:defs:value}
\end{figure*}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\PolicyID$ identifies monetary policies. A policy ID $\var{pid}$ is associated with a script
    $s$ such that $\fun{hashScript}~s~=~pid$. When a transaction attempts to create or destroy tokens
    that fall under the policy ID $\var{pid}$,
    $s$ verifies that the transaction
    respects the restrictions that are imposed by the monetary policy.
    See sections \ref{sec:transactions} and \ref{sec:utxo} for details.

  \item $\AssetName$ is a byte string used to distinguish different tokens with the same $\PolicyID$.
    Each $aname$ identifies a unique kind of token out of all the tokens under the
    $\var{pid}$ policy (but not necessarily among tokens kinds under other policies).
    The maximum length of this
    byte string is 32 bytes (this is not explicitly enforced in this spec).

  \item $\AssetID$ is a pair of the policy ID and the asset name. It is a unique and permanent
  identifier of an asset. That is, there are is no mechanism to change it or
  any part of it.

  Mary MA tokens are fungible with each other if and only if they belong to the same $\AssetID$,
  i.e. they have the same $\PolicyID$ and $\AssetName$.
  The reason the unique identifier is a pair of two terms is to allow
  minting arbitrary collections of fungible and unique tokens under a single policy.

  \item $\Quantity$ is an integer type that represents an amount of a specific $\AssetName$. We associate
    a term $q\in\Quantity$ with a specific token to track how much of that token is contained in a given asset value.

  \item $\Value$ is the multi-asset type that is used to represent
    a collection of tokens, including Ada. This type is a pair, where the first
    term represents the amount of Ada in the collection, and the second term
    represents all other assets except Ada.

    If $(\var{pid}, \var{aname})$ is an $\AssetID$ and $v \in \Value$,
    the quantity in $v$ belonging to that $\AssetID$ is $v~\var{pid}~\var{aname}$.
    Terms of type $\Value$ are sometimes also referred to as
    \emph{token bundles}.

   To be precise, the multi-asset
   type, $\Value$ is a finitely supported function of two variables,
   $\PolicyID$ and $\AssetName$ to $\Quantity$.

  \item $\fun{inject}$ takes a $\Coin$ amount and returns a $\Value$ containing
  that amount of Ada and no other assets.

  \item $\fun{coin}$ returns the amount of Ada contained in a $\Value$ term (ie.
  the first term of the pair).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Ada special case.} Making Ada a special case in the $\Value$ definition is useful
because Ada is the most common type of asset on the ledger. It also can
be used for special purposes (such as fees) for which other assets cannot be used.
Moreover, it is unlikely that tokens other than Ada can ever be used for this
purpose, as the underlying consensus algorithm relies on Ada in a way that
cannot be extended to user-defined tokens.
We sometimes refer to Ada as the primary or principal currency. Ada does not,
for the purposes of the Mary ledger spec, have a $\PolicyID$ or an $\AssetName$.

\subsection{Pointwise Value Operations and Partial Order}
We have a number of operations on $\Value$ left to define for it to have
$\ValMonoid$ structure. These are binary relations, addition, and
scalar multiplication. These are all done
pointwise in accordance with the usual definitions of these operations on
finitely supported maps, see Figure \ref{fig:pointwise}.

\begin{figure*}[t!]
  \begin{align*}
    & (c, v)~+~(d, w) =& (c+d, ~\{~ pid\mapsto_0 (aname\mapsto_0 (v~\var{pid}~\var{aname})~+~(w~\var{pid}~\var{aname}) ~\vert~ \\
    & & \var{pid} \in (\fun{policies}~v~\cup~\fun{policies}~w),~\var{aname}~\in~(\fun{anames}~v~\cup~\fun{anames}~w) ~\} )

  \end{align*}

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Other Examples of $\ValMonoid$.}

We give examples here of $\ValMonoid$-structured types
that are types similar to $\Value$ in spirit, and are used elsewhere
in the system (eg. the wallet).

\begin{itemize}
  \item The compact representation of $\Value$, $\mathsf{CompactValue}$. This
  is a compressed representation of $\Value$ that is isomorphic to it.
  All the $\ValMonoid$ operations
  are defined directly in terms of $\Value$ operations, by first converting
  to $\Value$, performing the operation, then converting back.

  \item The un-Curried representation of the map part of $\Value$. That is,
  the map term in $\Value$ has the type

  \[ \AssetID \mapsto \Quantity \]

  In this representation, which is also isomorphic to $\Value$, doing the
  $\ValMonoid$ operations pointwise directly on this type commutes with conversion to
  and from $\Value$.

  \item A $\Value$ representation that is not a pair of $\Coin$ and a map, but just
  the un-Curried map. Here, Ada is presented as having an $\AssetID$,
  like the other assets. It is still special, though, since we define a new
  $\AssetID$ type to be

  \[ \mathsf{AssetID'} ~=~ \mathsf{AdaID} \uniondistinct \AssetID \]

  This type is again isomorphic to $\Value$, with commuting operations. For
  example, the $\fun{inject}$ and $\fun{coin}$ maps are defined as follows :

  \[ \fun{inject}~c = \{ \mathsf{AdaID}~\mapsto~c \} \]

  \[ \fun{coin}~v = v~\mathsf{AdaID} \]
\end{itemize}
